This is a site for implementation guidance of [USAID's Development Data policy (ADS 579)](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pbaab096.pdf).  The intention of open data is to share information from USAID funded programs in such a way that others outside of the program could use it.

The main purpose of this site is to provide background about this policy, to share current required contract language, and most importantly to gain direct input and guidance from USAID CORs, AORs, implementing partners, and other stakeholders that are best positioned to identify where the contract language will meet the primary goal of open data- and what needs to be changed.
